    1. How the data was obtained 
    2. The filtering process 

figure 2:
- Summary stats  
    - BM cases, [total primary cases?],  BM prevalence, BM relative risk given metastasis
- Communicates:
    1. Difference between clinical case load, and likelihood of brain met across different conditions 
    2. 'Common' is Lung, and additionally skin if metastatic disease. 
- Should this be broken into cell types? 

figure 3:
- Informative features of brain metastasis risk 
    - Tstage, Nstage, Grade, Lymph node status, hist type, + extras (eg breast HER2+/-)
    - Panel A - Probably a heatmap lol fuk u Chris 
    - Panel B - Clustermap which cancers (& hist types?) behave similarly in terms of BM risk features
- Communicates: 
    1. Informative features of brain metastasis
    2. Hist type & primary cancer are most important features.
- Should be normalised against general metastasis?

figure 4:
- Classifiers 
    - Linear Model (no independence assumption)
    - Naive Bayes (independence assumption)
    - Decision Tree / random forest 
    - Neural Net (probably best performance) 
- Communicates: 
    1. Whether clinical data is sufficient to accurately predict BM likelihood. 
- Build each model for all data 
- Build each model independently for each primary cancer (include hist type)

Summary of data accessed
- how many patients / records
- year range
- patients at first presentation 

Figure 1: color case load by common vs uncommon
Figure 2: take out 'miscellaneous category'
Figure 2: fix wording of main takeaway 
Last figure in SEER metastasis slide deck - yes odds ratios good. 


---------------------
--- SEER SURVIVAL ---
---------------------
- common vs uncommon 
    - 2010-2015 vs 2016-2020
    - common had improvements in survival, but rare did not. 
- LN negative vs local vs distant 

-----------------
--- SEER CASE ---
-----------------

- NECTIN4
- Lymph-vascular Invasion (2004+ varying by schema)
- Site-Specific Data Items is goldmine? 
- 
- age 
    - 'productive years life lost'
- prostate cancer often grows for 15-20 years before diagnosis
- how can we measure aggressiveness? eg time from T1 -> T2 
- 

DONE
- odds ratios instead of relrisk 
- case load as blue heatmap 
- MI
- added "METS AT DX—OTHER (2016+)" to widen met scope.  

TODO 
- figs as previous heatmaps (heatmap / caseload / preference)
- focus on these cancer groups 
    - lung, skin, esophagous, breast, prostate, thyroid, kidney, pancreas, colorectal, stomach, liver
    - colorectal vs stomach 
    - prostate vs thyroid 
    - lung vs skin vs breast 
- 


QUESTIONS
- is the blood-brain barrier a filter, or is the brain soil itself harder to colonise?
- what are developmental milestones vs linear risk increases?
    - eg why does higher T-stage represent higher risk? 
      is it just a measure of general 'development' ie number of cell divisions? 
      is T4 a milestone? 
- According to Jin et al 2020 (MetMap)
- histology & subtypes
    - why do 'trophoblastic neoplasms' have unusually low bone & unusually high lung met rate? 
    - epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
        - important for 'epithelial' histological types in general
        - important for invasion of Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC).
        - E-cadherin inactivated. (cell-cell adhesion)
        - N-cadherin and vimentin activated.
        - 'lobular' types characterised by loss of E-cadherin
            - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK164700/
            - does this suggest that 'lobular' types already in a mesenchymal state?
    - breast cancer notes:
        - need more fields from SEER relating to breast subtypes?
        - five molecular subtypes
            - luminal subtype A
            - luminal subtype B
            - normal breast-like subtype
            - HER-2 overexpression subtype
            - basal-like subtype.
        - BLBC
            - aggressive molecular subtype of breast cancer
            - also known as 'triple negative breast cancer' (HR-/HER2-)
        - nebulous moecular biological characteristics

Hallmarks 
- Sustaining proliferative signalling
- Evading growth suppressors
- Avoiding immune destruction
- Enabling replicative immortality
- Tumor-promoting inflammation
- Activating invasion & metastasis*
- Inducing or accessing vasculature*
- Genome instability & mutation
- Resisting cell death
- Deregulating cellular metabolism
- (emerging) unlocking phenotypic plasticity*
- (emerging) nonmutational epigenetic reprogramming*

TODO [brainmets data]
- endothelial membrane permeability https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK164700/
- focus on lung/skin/breast/prostate -> brain 
- epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal-like_carcinoma
    - EMT -> intravasation -> exit bloodstream (micro-metastases) -> MET (enables clonal outgrowth).
    - EMT and MET form the initiation and completion of the invasion-metastasis cascade
    - epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and cell–cell adhesion, 
      gain migratory and invasive properties to become mesenchymal stem cells.
    - Mesenchymal stem cells are multipotent stromal cells that can differentiate into a variety of cell types.
    - EMT markers:        N-cadherin and vimentin
    - epithelial markers: E-cadherin
    - Activation of TGF-β, Wnt, and Notch pathways in BLBC leads to the expression of EMT-related transcription factors
    - breast cancer mainly? 
- GSEA 
    - groups need to be defined thoughtfully. 
    - Burton
    - hallmarks 
    - GO signalling pathways
    - GO metabolic processes 
    - Reactome?

TODO [seer data]
- how often does each cancer have secondary but no distant LN? 
- heatmap neither, local, local+dist. 

- add fields
    - biomarkers such as E-cadherin?
- primary -> blood -> secondary 
    - check whether difference between simple distant_ln==True vs ln_stats=='positive local+distant'
    - heatmap rather than just tables  (brain, bone, lung, liver, other, any)
    - groups:
        - cancer_group
        - hist_cateogry
        - hist_type_descr
        - cancer_group:hist_cateogry
        - cancer_group:hist_type_descr
    - remove T1 then repeat the above
    - remove T1/T2 then repeat the above?
    - focus on epithelial histologic types - can we see EMT?
    - also calc stats for cancers which have secondary but no distant LN.
    - what is the difference epithelial vs non-epithalial types? 
        - basal metastasis rate vs metastasis rate after blood invasion 
        - remove unspecified neoplasms
- can the differences in metastasis rate (metastatic/invasive potential) between cancer groups
  or histologies be primarily explained by how likely the cancer is to invade bloodstream?

- visualise heatmap data as petal plot instead (radar/polar) 
    - as per MetMap paper
    - will produce similar results
- prove that , and 
    - only currently measuring brain/bone/lung/liver secondary sites. 
- Histology 
- any_met rate vs secondary site specific
- group cancers into preference:common/intermediate/uncommon and run stats 

- dependence vs independence between variables
- PCA clustering? cancer_type, want to see that Prostate and Thyroid are similar?

- lung -> lung met???
- TODO: make sure 'regional_nodes_positive' is correct 

Commons uncommons 
- clinical vs biological 
- case load, prevalence, preference
- case load:
    - commons: lung, skin, breast, kidney, colorectal
    - intermediates: [others]
    - uncommons: leukemias, lymphomas etc 
- prevalence:
    - commons: lung, upper digestive organs (including esophagus), respiratory organs, kidney
    - intermediates: [others]
    - uncommons: prostate, thyroid, lymphomas, leukemias, lower digestive organs (pancreas?, colorectal, appendix, small intestine, stomach?)
- preference:
    - commons: lung, skin, leukemias? 
    - intermediates: [others]
    - uncommons: prostate, lower digestive organs (pancreas, colorectal, appendix, small intestine, bile, stomach?) 

Most Informative Features
    Mutual information 
    - Groups: cancer_groups, hist_type, cancer_group:hist_types
    - Features: Tstage, Nstage, Grade, hist_type (only cancer types), Tstage:Nstage

    T-stage more informative than Grade or Nstage 
    - slide 57 do this but each set of dots/trendline is brain/bone/lung/liver met 
    - Tstage has 4 levels (T1,T2,T3,T4)
    - Tstage ramp more extreme (seems exponential)
    - Tstage ramp more/less extreme depending on cancer_type 
    - Nstage has two levels
    - is this trend broken for a specific cancer type? 

Seed soil 
- Tissue type more important than histologic type
    - eg lung always more metastatic than any given breast subtype
    - but, histology important for prostate cancers 
- Combining tissue+histology does further refine risk 
- Throw in grade? 
    - would need to prove that adding grade onto tissue/histtype/tissue:histtype more informative than adding tstage 
    - this sounds like feature selection 
- breast
    - 'breast:epithelial' looks like lung 
    - subtypes vs hist types
    - subtypes + hist types
- Prostate 
    - PSA and risk 
    - Prostate and Thyroid are similar in Tstage, Nstage, Grade profiles (2D distance matrices)

Lymph Nodes 
    LN status 
    - neither:                  low
    - locoregional:             low
    - locoregional + distant:   high

general notes 
- pancreas, 'other biliary' have N01 staging. why some cases of N2?
- appendix:
    - Carcinoma & Carcinoid are distinct categories 
    - Carcinoma == N012  
    - Carcinoid == N01  
- Corpus Uteri:
    - Carcinomas * Sarcomas are distinct categories 
        - Carcinosarcomas should be staged as carcinoma. 
    - Carcinomas == N012 
    - Sarcomas   == N01  

- CS tumor size % CS extension eval == method for evaluating T-stage 
- CS lymph nodes eval               == method for evaluating N-stage 
- T-stage 
    - size or contiguous extension of the primary tumor. 
    - roles of the size component and the extent of contiguous spread in defining T are specifically defined for each cancer site
- N-stage 
    - Absence, or presence and extent of cancer in the regional draining lymph nodes. 
    - Nodal involvement is categorized by the number of positive nodes, and 
    - for certain cancer sites by the involvement of specific regional nodal groups. 

- for some cancers in AJCC7th and above, M1b designates distant metastases.
- Stage is a combination of TNM. 
                      T    N    M
  eg Lung Stage IIA:  T2b  N0  M0
                      T1a  N1  M0
                      T1b  N1  M0
                      T2a  N1  M0 
  
  eg Lung Stage IIIA: T1a  N2  M0
                      T1b  N2  M0
                      T2a  N2  M0
                      T2b  N2  M0
                      T3   N1  M0
                      T3   N2  M0
                      T4   N0  M0       <- T4 + N0/N1 (N2/N3 pushes you into stage IIIB)

oncofetal signatures in brain metastasis 


------------------
--- LITERATURE ---
------------------

Common
Lung, breast, skin, esophagus, kidney

Uncommon 
Leukemia, prostate, colorectal 

Breast
- Higher metastasis rate: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2 positive (HER2+)
- Lower metastasis rate: Hormone receptor positive tumors (ER+ or PR+) 

Lung
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9689009/
- Only cases with pathologically confirmed diagnoses were included
- Fields: 
    - age at diagnosis
    - sex 
    - ICD-0-3 TNG stage, grade 
    - histology codes
    - histological diagnosis
    - history of other malignancy
    - presence of metastasis
    - sites of distant metastasis
    - presence of recurrence
    - sites of recurrence
- Younger patients have higher metastasis rate in most histologic subtypes
- Bone (60%), CNS (45%), liver (25%) and adrenal gland (20%) are preferred secondary sites
- histologic types are important
    - Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma:                   ↑ Bone 
    - Small cell carcinoma:                         ↑ Liver 
    - large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC):  ↑ Liver; ↓ Bone

--- QUESTIONS ---
-----------------
Lung, breast, skin, renal, colorectal
- breast -> brain: low 
- lung -> brain: high

Propensity
- eg prevalence within metastatic prostate cancer
- prostate -> brain 
- prostate -> other secondary sites

prevalence - 1 timepoint 
incidence  - 2 timepoint 

biological vs clinical definitions
looking forward vs retroactively



Factors which contribute to brain met risk 
- primary 
- histological type 
- subtypes (well established clinical subtype / division of sig. proportion) (breast Hr/HER2)
- age 
- pediatric cancer? 


Common vs uncommon
1. Do the existing common | uncommon categories make sense? (prevalence) [✔] 
    - What about splitting breast by subtype (HR/HER2 etc)

2. Is there a better, data-driven definition of common vs uncommon? [-]
    - TODO set min_cases=1000
    - TODO incidence, not prevalence

3. Do common | uncommons have differences in clinical features?
    - TNM stage, group stage, grade, histology, rate of spread, blood markers, cancer subtypes (HER2+/- etc)

Histology 
- histology code may be more informative than primary 
    - lung has high propensity for metastasis, but different hist_types show different patterns of metastasis
    - 

Secondary site
4. For each primary, what is it's liver/bone/lung/brain secondary site tendancies (prevalence, incidence)
5. What clinical feature(s) differentiate metastasis to brain, vs metastasis to other regions?
    - include age, ethnicity, gender



# not as important
Lymph nodes
6. What is the relationship between local vs distant nodes positive & brain met incidence?
    - What is the incidence rate of brain met, if spread only to local lymph nodes?
    - What is the incidence rate of brain met, if spread to distant lymph nodes?
    - Incidence rate ratio of the above
    - Survival curve (time to brain met) of the above

7. clustering primaries vs brain met risk
    - all features + smoking, breast subtype etc










- Risk 
    - single variable 
    - multiple variables 
        - TSTAGE=1; NSTAGE=1vs2
        - TSTAGE=2; NSTAGE=1vs2
        - TSTAGE=3; NSTAGE=1vs2
        - TSTAGE=4; NSTAGE=1vs2
Do brain mets develop differently for these categories?
What features predict BM?
Primary site, common, t_stage, n_stage, hist_type, etc

- INCIDENCE 
    - priamry_site
    - incidence rate ratios rather than odds ratios 
    - Survival curves (but brain met)

Sites 
- assumed_primary (for a given brain met)
- Breast: 2 categories.
    - low stage, low grade: low probability of metastasis in general 
    - molecular subtypes for breast cancer determine aggressiveness (TNBC=most lethal/aggressive, HER2 etc)
- check placenta C589 "other female..."

Contrasts 
- do everything with site_category
- lung vs rest 
    - lung is super different from everything? 
- historical 'common' vs rest           [lung, breast, renal, skin, colorectal]
- data-driven 'common' vs rest          [lung, esophagus, renal, testis] (above 1% prev)
- data-driven 'uncommon' vs rest        [prostate, leukemia]
- data-driven 'common' vs data-driven 'uncommon'

- single vs multisite
    - do odds ratios etc for sinlges 
    - add last tumor for multis 
    - do they differ? 

AJCC stage group 
- don't mix c & p 
- c = clinical 
- p = pathological

PSA 
- only produced in prostate
- if detected in blood == you have a prostate. 
- if prostate removed && you still have PSA, you have met / circulating tumor cells 
    - PSA reading == 0.01-0.2: 10% will have a met
    - PSA reading == 0.2-0.1:  50% will have a met

RESEARCH QUESTIONS
- Prostate doesn't go to brain cuz slow growing?
- Is there a data-driven definition of common|uncommon BM primaries? adjust for:
    - cancer growth rate 
    - how 'early' a cancer is detected (community screening/checkups)?
- What features (t_stage; n_stage; t_stage+n_stage; hist_type) predict BM? 

IMPORTANT
- conditional probabilities / or normalization absolutely required. 
    - OK?:  Odds ratio LUNG G1 vs G2 cuz single variable tested.
    - OK?:  Mutual Information ALL_SITES G1 vs G2 cuz single variable tested.
    - BAD:  Odds ratio LUNG_G1 vs PROSTATE_G1 cuz 2 variables (primary; stage)
- multivariate statistics probably best 
    - JUST OK: T_STAGE alone to predict BM. 
    - BETTER: A combination of T_STAGE and N_STAGE.

Main items
- prevalence (period prev 2010-2020)
- incidence (non-bm patients who later developed a bm)
- Do grade again, but comparison is odds ratio (common&T1 vs uncommon &T1) etc
- mutual information (MI)
- conditional mutual information (CMI)
- multivariate information (MVI) theory 
- decision tree 


Prevalence: 
- the proportion of all people in the study population who have the outcome of interest (e.g., disease or condition) at a particular time
- # people affected / # people in study 
- X cases per Y people
- eg 
    # people in study = 10,000
    # diabetes = 1,000
    prevalence = 1,000 / 10,000 
        or 100 cases per 1,000 people
        or 10 cases per 100 people 
        or 1 in 10
- point prevalence: prevalence at single point in time (eg "as of 2020")
- period prevalence: prevalence within a time range (eg 2010-2015)

Incidence:
- different to prevalence
- the proportion of at-risk subjects who develop the outcome of interest
- incidence proportion: probability of developing BM before 2020 among all subjects at risk
- incidence rate:       frequency per time per person (eg 11.1 new cases of BM per year per 1000 ppl)  
- eg 
    10,000 subjects
    1,000 already have diabetes 
    9,000 at risk
    5 year observation period, 500 new cases by end 

    incidence proportion (cumulative incidence):
    500/9000 or 55.5 cases per 1000 or 5.6%
    
    incidence rate:
    total person years = 9000 * 5 = 45,000
    500/45,000 = 11.1 cases per 1000 ppl per year 

incidence rate ratio (IRRs)
- need at least 2 time points
- https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP7246
- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK555593/figure/ch5.fig2/
- incidence rate per primary = x per 10000 cases 
- split into 
    - primary type
    - common/uncommon
    - T/N stage 
    - Group stage 
    - Grade
- ratios can then be calculated 
    - common vs common 
    - breast vs prostate
    - Grade.G2 vs Grade.G1 etc 
- p-value? CI? does this need group mean test?
- eg 
    HRT     # with disease  
    YES     30
    NO      60


Risk
- "the probability that an outcome will occur"
- need at least 2 time points
- risk ratio = relative risk = RR
- joint/marginal probabilities
- risk of BM = has_bm/no_bm (entire dataset)
                YES_BM  NO_BM   Grade Margin
    Grade.G2         a      b            a+b
    Grade.G1         c      d            c+d
    BM Margin      a+c    b+d

- risk Grade.G2 G2 = a/a+b
- risk Grade.G1 G1 = c/c+d
- risk ratio  (G2) = G2 / G1
- excess risk (G2) = G2 - G1   (attributable risk)
- p-value? 

odds ratio 
- a single point in time 
- https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Odds-ratio-OR-and-95-confidence-interval-CI-per-increment-of-1-standard-deviation-of_fig2_292071941
- same as RR but odds 
- odds "the probability that an event occurs divided by the probability that the event does not occur"

Hazard ratio
- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC478551/
- cox proportional hazards model
- survival analysis
- Students t-test (para) or Wilcoxon rank-sum test (non-para)?
- comparing two groups
- similar to IRRs 
"Hazard ratios differ from relative risks (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs) in that RRs and ORs are cumulative over an entire study, using a defined endpoint, while HRs represent instantaneous risk over the study time period, or some subset thereof. Hazard ratios suffer somewhat less from selection bias with respect to the endpoints chosen and can indicate risks that happen before the endpoint."

Mutual information 
- measures patterns of change for categorical variables
- if we want continuous variables
    - create histogram  
    - use each bin as discrete cateogry 
- both negative correlation and positive result in same MI value (ie can be inverse relationship)
- calc perfect situation (var1 & var2 exact same for each obs) for relative scaling? 

---------------------
--- MODEL FITTING ---
---------------------

Model Fitting Strategy
- For each method, do feature selection rather than feature extraction
- Akaike information criterion (AIC) or something to penalise model complexity? 
- plot num_features vs accuracy (or some other metric) to decide 
- FDR for multiple testing needs to be calculated
